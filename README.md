## Welcome to Python.


It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. 

Python scripts were created to analyze the financial statements of PyBank and the election result of PyPoll.

PyBank’s dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.  

The scripts calculated the following:
  
    * The total number of months included in the dataset
    
    * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    
    * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    
    * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    
    * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
